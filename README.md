- Priotize notifications from your preferred repos, organizations, or users
- Create reminders for certain notifications, for example, to remember that you need to review a pull request
- Create shortcuts to your favorite repos
- Integration with push notifications in your browser
- See the results of your Continuous Integration platforms & deploys directly from your dashboard
- Ignore notifications from certain repo, organization, or users

## Installation
